					Hi there.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					We’re contacting you because you’ve been put forward as a potential candidate for the New Rule contest.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					Are you familiar with the game?
				</p>
				<span class="timestamp">11:43 AM</span>
			</div>
			<div class="message sent">
				<p>
					Sure, everyone on campus is talking about it. Is this a prank? How do I know you’re not just messing with me?
				</p>
				<span class="timestamp">11:47 AM</span>

			<div class="message received">
				<p>
					Allow me to introduce myself. I’m Rex, and I work for New Rule. My job is to guide you through the onboarding process to get you started with the game.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					I understand your hesitation. The college rumor mill isn’t always the most accurate source. There’s a lot of buzz, but most people don’t know the real details. The contest is much bigger than the rumors let on. Only a select few understand the full scope of New Rule, and I’m here to help you navigate it.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					To show I’m serious, I’m willing to send you a $500 advance. We can transfer the funds via PayPal. How does that sound?
				</p>
 				<span class="timestamp">13:12 PM</span>
			</div>
			<div class="message sent">
				<p>
					Ok, if you’re serious about sending me money, I’ll listen. But what’s the catch?
				</p>
				<span class="timestamp">14:32 PM</span>
			</div>
			<div class="message received">
				<p>
					There’s no catch. All I need is your PayPal email, and I’ll send over the advance to prove we’re for real. Once that’s sorted, I’ll guide you through the next steps, including setting up your account in the New Rule app and syncing your smart ring, which helps track your commitment to the contest.
					<br />
					You can reach me at <a href="mailto:rex.k@newrule.con">rex.k@newrule.con</a>.</p>

					I just sent you my PayPal email. If the money comes through, we can talk.

					I just got the $500. This is for real, huh?

					Glad to hear it came through! Now that you’re on board, let’s get you started with the setup.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					First, download the New Rule app and create your profile. The app works like a social media platform, letting you track your participation, see the rewards, and engage with the audience who follow along with the contestants.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					We’ll also be sending a courier over with a complimentary smart ring, designed to support and enhance your efforts to fulfil an succeed in the contest. Once it arrives, you’ll need to sync it with the app to track your progress. Send me your address, and I’ll get the ring shipped to you right away.

			<div class="message sent">
				<p>Ok, I’ve downloaded the app and set up my account. Just sent you my address.</p>
				<span class="timestamp">12:12 PM</span>
			</div>
			<div class="message sent">
				<p>Ok. This is legit! I'm going to be playing New Rule.</p>
				<span class="timestamp">13:52 PM</span>
			</div>
			<div class="message received">
				<p>
					I see you've sync'd your smart ring with your account.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					If you could upload a selfie for your profile pic, and add a few details to your interests? Once you’ve completed that, I’ll list you as an official contestant in the app, and you can get started with week one.
				</p>
				<p>
					Good luck, Mika! If you have any questions, feel free to message me through the app @Rex.
